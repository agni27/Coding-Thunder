Blog to learn about various coding technologies(Used express js)
I recently developed an Express.js app that serves as a blog for teaching various coding technologies. The app covers topics such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React JS and Node.js.

The blog features a clean and user-friendly interface that makes it easy for users to navigate and find the content they are looking for. Each post is written in a clear and concise manner, with plenty of examples and code snippets to help users understand the concepts being discussed.

Overall, this project was a great opportunity for me to showcase my skills in Express.js development. I am proud of the final product and I believe it will be a valuable resource for anyone looking to learn more about these technologies.
